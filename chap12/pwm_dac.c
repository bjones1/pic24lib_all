/** \file
Demonstrates a PWM DAC - connect an RC filter on the OC1
output and vary the pulse width of the PWM signal, and monitor
the DC value on the capacitor. The RC time constant should
be at least 10x greater than the PWM period. Examples values
used for testing were R=6.8k, C = 1.0u, PWM period= 500 us
This projects uses an external crystal for accuracy.
CLOCK_CONFIG=PRIPLL_8MHzCrystal_40MHzFCY is defined in the MPLAB project.
Remove this macro if you wish to use the internal oscillator.
