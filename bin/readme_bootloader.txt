To install the bootloader, you have two choices:

a. Execute the bully.msi installer. This installs the program under Program Files, 
and places a Bully Bootloader choice in your "All Programs" list.

OR

b. Copy the files winbootldr.exe, devices.txt, and the Micrsoft.VC80.CRT folder to a folder of your choice.
